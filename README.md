# Order Processing System

## Objective

The Order Processing System is a Java project aimed at simulating order processing functionalities using inheritance and custom container classes. It provides implementations for Queue and Stack data structures to manage orders based on certain criteria.

### Skills Learned

- Implementing inheritance to create specialized classes
- Utilizing encapsulation for maintaining data integrity and code organization
- Designing and implementing custom container classes for managing collections of objects
- Handling file input/output operations and exception handling in Java
- Writing test cases using JUnit for ensuring code correctness and functionality

### Tools Used

- **Java**: The project is developed in Java, a widely-used programming language known for its flexibility and performance.
- **JUnit**: Test cases are written using JUnit, a popular unit testing framework for Java.
- **GitHub**: The project is hosted on GitHub, providing version control, collaboration, and project showcase features.

## Getting Started

To use the Order Processing System, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `QueueTest` and `StackTest` classes to execute the test cases and ensure code functionality.
4. Explore the `Container`, `Queue`, `Stack`, and `IOHandler` classes to understand their roles and functionalities.

## Project Structure

- `Container.java`: A base class for managing objects in an array-like structure.
- `Queue.java`: Represents a queue data structure for managing orders based on specific criteria.
- `Stack.java`: Represents a stack data structure for managing orders based on specific criteria.
- `IOHandler.java`: Utility class for handling file input/output operations.
- `Order.java`: Represents an order entity with order details.
- `QueueTest.java`: Contains test cases for the `Queue` class.
- `StackTest.java`: Contains test cases for the `Stack` class.
